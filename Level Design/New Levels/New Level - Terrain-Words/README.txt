Terrain-Words Level.

Baba has terrain, Lala has words only. 
Baba is stuck within a walled enclosure. Lala however cannot change/break the WALL IS STOP statement as it is inaccessible on the edge of the screen. Lala therefore needs to change the THEM statement to SKULL IS THEM, thus making Baba a skull, and free. 

The second part involves aligning the rocks and using them to push the flag out of its enclosure. Might need to add a AND block so Flag can be both WIN and PUSH, but you get the idea.
