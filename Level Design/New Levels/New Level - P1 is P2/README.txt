(Misunderstood the Trello prompt on this one, guess it could be better described as a Co-op Level)

Co-op Level

In this level both players exist in the exact same space. They (naturally) need to work together to win. One has to become WALL, and the other ROCKS. The wall player then needs to move down and help the rocks player align the rocks to push the IS word down to complete the FLAG statement. Then they can get the flag.
