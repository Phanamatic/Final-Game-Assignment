You Is Me (mind the clunky name)

The level starts with P1 controlling the character on P2's screen, and vice versa. Players therefore need to communicate to each other how to move, as both will be moving blind so to speak. 

For added complexity, the flag on Lala's screen seems inaccessible at first. The solution is to change LALA IS YOU, to WALL IS YOU, thus allowing the player to move the walls up/down in order to get the flag
