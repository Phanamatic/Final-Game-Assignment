Placeholder Level.

Black squares represent slots that occupy both screens. Players can use each other's words to complete statements, such as in the simple tutorial bit where both have ROCK within the first black slot. They can then use their respective IS and PUSH blocks to complete the statement across their screens.

The second portion of the level is more of the same, but with added complications. NOTE: WATER IS FLOAT is not an applicable statement. The correct way to solve it is to make LALA IS FLOAT, and WATER IS PUSH, so that Lala can float to her goal, and Baba can push the water away from his flag and win.

(The updated version no longer uses rocks as an obstacle as per our discussion in class)
