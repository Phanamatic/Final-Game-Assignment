LEVEL 2 - TELEPORT

Here players gain the ability to change each other. With the use of THEM statements, players can change how the other appears. In this level, Baba and Lala need to change each other into rocks and walls respectively. This needs to occur at the exact same time, to work, as players will find out after trial and error. (If Baba is turned to rock too soon, the THEM statement becomes inaccessible, and vice versa)

So Baba will push WALL and prime it to be swapped with LALA. Lala will push ROCK and prime it to be swapped with Baba. They'll push it at the same time, and Baba will become rock and Lala will become wall, thus allowing both of them to reach their respective flags.

Note on name:
Baba will see TELE on load screen, and Lala will see PORT. If they communicate this, they get a small hint. ("we need to TELEPORT"). It's not actual teleportation obviously, its more just moving each others conscious to another object, but I reckon it works.
