Tutorial - R U STUCK 2

Here the players learn that game statements can be changed, and broken. On Baba's screen, Baba can move PUSH, to complete a ROCK IS PUSH statement, thus allowing Lala to get to the flag. Lala needs to break the WALL IS STOP statement, so that Baba can move through the wall to their flag. Its a simple tutorial which teaches the players that the world can be altered, and that they need to rely on each other.

Note on level names:
In 'Baba is You' the level names appear in a loading screen before the level. I thought maybe we could have it that each player sees a different screen, so Baba will see "R U" and Lala will see "STUCK 2". It kinda plays into the verbal cooperation thing, if in a small way. Later levels (see TELEPORT) even use this to hint at a solution.
